# Multilayer Perceptron - Breast Cancer Prediction

This project involves creating a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model that predicts whether a woman has breast cancer based on various features. The model is trained using a breast cancer dataset, which can be downloaded from the provided link.

## Dataset

You can download the dataset from the following link: [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/document/document/22559/data.csv)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

Download the dataset from the link above and place it in your project directory.

### Step 2: Preprocess the Data

Run the `DataProcess.py` script to preprocess the dataset. You can execute this script using:

```bash
python DataProcess.py
```

### Step 3: Train the Model

To train the model, run the `train_module.py` script using the preprocessed data generated by `DataProcess.py`:

```bash
python train_module.py --data_train PreProcessedData/train.csv
```

This script will generate two PNG files:

- A plot of the accuracy over each epoch `accuracy_curve.png`.
- A plot of the loss over each epoch `loss_curve.png`.

### Step 4: Predict with the Model

To make predictions with the trained model on unknown test data, use the `pred_module.py` script. This script takes the test data generated by `DataProcess.py` and outputs the accuracy and loss metrics:

```bash
python pred_module.py --data_test PreProcessedData/test.csv
```

### Command Line Arguments

You can see all necessary and optional arguments by running:

```bash
python train_module.py -h
```
or

```bash
python pred_module.py -h
```

### Requirements


You can install all necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
